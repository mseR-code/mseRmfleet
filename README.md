# mseRmfleet

This is the repository for the master version of the multi-fleet mseR software package *mseRmfleet*. The master branch of this version should remain 'publishable,' which means that any application or development should occur on secondary branches or forked copies of this repository, only.

## About mseR

*mseR*, or *Management Strategy Evaluation in R*, is a custom software package for closed loop simulation of fishery management systems. ... crib from Sean's previous notes here.

## Installation

## Idea behind master version

When a research project or contract for closed loop sim analysis is started, the analyst should fork this repository. Any application/path specific development can then occur in a quarantined space, which insulates the master copy from bugs. When the application/research is complete, new features can then be integrated back into the master copy, which will require updating the documentation and conducting a suite of standardised tests (see wiki) to ensure that the features work and are bug free.
