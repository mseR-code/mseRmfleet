The R library 'PBStry' can be used as a small prototype for 
R package development. It comes as part of the library 
'PBSmodelling'.

This prototype contains six functions and a data set from 
'PBSmodelling'. It also illustrates how to use the R function 
'.C', which invokes code compiled from functions written 
separately in C.

For more information, see the file 'PBSmodelling-UG.pdf', a 
user's guide included with 'PBSmodelling'.
